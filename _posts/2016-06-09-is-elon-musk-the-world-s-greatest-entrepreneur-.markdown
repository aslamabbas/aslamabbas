+	The CEO and CTO of SpaceX, a company that outsmarted NASA in building reusable spacecrafts. It became the first private company to send a spacecraft to ISS.

His aims in life are very simple. He wants to send people to Mars, setup a colony and thereby help the survival of the human species. That doesn't mean he is not bothered about the present planet we are living on. He aims to exploit sustainable and renewable sources of energy to the fullest and thus do his part in reducing global warming. The fact that two of his ventures Tesla and SolarCity are purely based on electric power, tells us how determined he is on this goal. He also wants people to travel faster. I mean a hell lot faster. For that he came up with the idea of [Hyperloop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperloop). Its pretty cool. You should check it up.

Over time, we have seen and heard plenty of intellectuals who have preached similar ideas. But Musk is a man who walks his talk. He is a classic living example of the saying - "Actions speak louder than words".

**Secrets of his Success**

Elon Musk trusts his instincts a lot. In the case of Paypal,
