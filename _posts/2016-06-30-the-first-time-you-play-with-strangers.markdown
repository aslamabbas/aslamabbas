All our stuff have been moved out of that room. My mother and sister were busy unpacking things, setting up things and putting everything where it belongs. I was busy roaming around the new house. The walls and rooms were familiar. I had been to this house a couple of times. It originally belonged to my uncle. I was told my father bought it from him, so that uncle and his family could move to a new house. The best thing was that the house had two floors and a terrace. I could see the entire road from the terrace. We had a temple adjacent to the house. It had a plain vast ground. There was a raised platform at one corner with a big banyan 

It was summer vacation. Most of my stuff were in ruins.
