**The Plan**

_"The time has come to escape somewhere. Somewhere remote, somewhere wild and beautiful at the sametime"._

This was all I could think of for the past few weeks and I would browse [tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.in/) and other blogs for the perfect escape. I was confused.

_"Should I go alone or should I call my friends? It would be boring to go solo. But who would have the time and budget to make such a trip!"_

And I was nowhere near to finding a destination as well. As I was knocking around these thoughts in my mind, I got a call from [Appu](https://plus.google.com/101526879864814957864). Appu is a guy who doesn't do the usual chit-chat. He gets staright to the point. 

_"Shall we go to north-east, Aslam?"_, he asked. Oh boy! You know, when what you are searching for findes you, it brings a special joy. I told him, I was also making a plan. He said that we just have to fix the dates, book the tickets and the rest we can plan along the way. The game was on. Other heads started popping in. It turned out that every one was exhausted by the dreaded office life and they all dreamt of a break. The NE trip whatsapp group was born. [Sajeev](https://www.facebook.com/619aswin), [Prasad](https://www.facebook.com/ashwin.prasad.54), [Kartha](https://www.facebook.com/vipinvkartha), [Deepu](https://www.facebook.com/deepuc1) and [Sebastian](https://www.facebook.com/sebastianthom) joined the trip. So many of our common friends had already visited places in north-east India. The amazing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix6MUQ31j9k) they made became one of our many inspirations to go to north-east. There were so many choices in north-east ranging from Gangtok, Chirapunji, Meghalaya and the list goes on.

_"Boys, Let's go to Gangtok. Plan later, book the tickets first before the rates go sky high."_, said Appu. We obliged. After carfeul consideration of available dates, we booked flight tickets to [Guwahati Airport](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Lokpriya+Gopinath+Bordoloi+International+Airport/@26.1064727,91.5860468,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x69ba1fb4e82844d8?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj2gM3pgOXTAhUMso8KHQhZA5MQ_BIIgAEwCg). The dates were from Apr 29 to May 7. All of us booked the cheapest flights (SpiceJet, ofcourse!) and started looking for itenaries to Gangtok. Meanwhile, I started calling travel groups to get an estimate about how much the travel would cost each of us. My calculations put me at 25,000 INR per person for 7 days including airfare. We had already booked the tickets, and there was no going back. So the planning continued. 

_"Hey have you heard of Tawang and Sela pass? It is a remote place, and very beautiful too. Check it out!"_. As soon as Kartha mentioned Tawang, the group came alive. The words, **Tawang, the Hidden Paradise**, instantly caught my attention. It is not as famous as the other tourist spots, which means lesser tourists, more freedom. There is a chance of finding snow in Sela Pass, which is on the way to Tawang. Everyone started digging up photos and itineraies for Tawang. Everyone except Sebastian maybe. If I remember properly, he was ok with anything as long as we were all going. So, Tawang it was. 

Now the next cruicial element of the trip, the instrument of transport. It was **rent a bike** Vs **rent a cab** Vs **self-drive car**. The **rent a cab** option quickly went out of the window. Incidentally, one of our friends had already gone to Tawang. He shared with us the pictures of Dirang Valley and the wonderful condition of the roads and hairpins that lay ahead. He warned us that self-driving is dangerous and tedious. Even their cabdriver was having a tough time. The warning had the reverse effect. Everyone took it as a challenge to ride the roads, rather than to sit in the back of some stranger's car. And the **rent a bike** option was crossed out, since most of us were better at driving cars than riding bikes. So we booked a Mahindra Scorpio from ZoomCar for 7 days. They recently started out in Guwahati, so it was the perfect timing for us. We didn't prebook any hotels. Sajeev and myself were not so happy with that decision, but after a sarcastic lecture from Appu on how overplanning ruins the fun of a trip, we gave in. It turned out to be the right decision.

**Zeroth Day - Apr 28, 2017**

Did I forget to mention the Inner Line Permit (ILP)? I guess I did. ILP is mandatory in many places in north-east. Because these are border areas with a lot of army presence. I read in some [blogs](https://thelazytravellersnews.wordpress.com/2015/05/24/arunchal-pradesh-tawang-darshan-inner-line-permit-and-bumla-pass-process/) that getting them offline in the Guwahati office can be a bit of a hassle. So we opted for the [online](http://arunachalilp.com/) application. The online application costs 100 INR per head and the offline only 10 INR. It takes a few days, but you will get it. Additional to the ILP, we also took a copy of an ID-proof. 

>Free advice: Let me tell you in advance that one copy is not enough. Take 4-5 copies of ID-proof and 2 copies of ILP if you are planning to visit BumLa Pass. The additional ID-proof copies may come handy when you are booking the hotel in Tawang.

Sebastian and Prasad had come to my place in Bangalore. Appu should also have joined us, but he preferred to stay with his friends in mysore. His buddies there were planning to go to Nandi Hills on bike, so they dropped Appu on the way. He later regretted that decision, because he lost all his sleep. The four of us had straight flights ahead from Bangalore airport to Guwahati airport. Sajeev and Deepu were to fly in from Chennai Airport with a stop in Kolkata. Poor Guys! They were the first ones to reach Guwahati and grabbing the Scorpio from ZoomCar was their duty. Kartha was to fly in from Pune and land at the sametime as the Bangalore bunch. With a last check on our back packs, we flew off to Guwahati.

**First Day - Apr 29, 2017**

For a change, the Spice Jet flights arrived on time. Guwahati Airport was neither well maintained nor large as its Bangalore counterpart. It had a parking lot the size of two Basket Ball courts. All of us took our backpacks and grabbed a seat in the nearest KFC. No, we didn't have KFC for breakfast. We were just waiting for Sajeev and Deepu to come and pick us up in the Scorpio. An hour passed, waiting for them. Meanwhile we took out our cameras and inspected them. Sebastian had brought a digital Nikon. That camera had a mind of its own. From time to time it would zoom in and out. Plus, the capture button was too stubborn. It would not work no matter how hard I pressed. Deepu had also brought a camera. It was an oldie, but still functioned properly. Fortunately, Deepu and Appu had Iphones. So that would suffice. 

It was almost 10.30 am. Finally they came with the Scorpio, a mighty blue beast. We hoped on and the first thing that we did was check the fuel and tyre pressure. Deepu was the navigator and Sajeev was the driver. We set the destination to Bhalukpong and drove on. None of us had eaten anything and were extremely hungry. We looked for hotels on the highway, but couldn't find anything decent. The view along the road reminded me of Kerala. There were a lot of green pastures, paddy fields and small hills. However Guwahati didn't have the one thing Kerala has, an amplitude of hotels along the highway. Finally we settled for a small hotel. There was no menu as such.There was only Poori and Sabji. That become our brunch. Two hours into the trip and I realised that sitting in the back of the Scorpio is a pain in the ass. So we decided to stop here-and-there and shift places and the driver.

There are some tourist places in Guwahati, temples mostly. We didn't stop at any of those places because we wanted to reach Bhalkupong before sunset. The road ahead was in good condition. We didn't face any traffic. We did get a bit lost when we tried for a detour near tezpur. The detour took us through a small village. We were a bit surprised. It looked exactly like a village you would see in Alleppy. We even saw a grandma coming out of church in traditional kerala christian attire. Someone in the back asked, _"Did we loose our way and end up in Keralam?"_. The similarities were that close. Even the shops and markets resemebled that of Kerala from 2000s. We passed a lot of schools on the way. Most of them had white uniforms with senior girls wearing white sarees. Pretty soon we got back on the Highway and stopped for a cup of tea. The tea session quickly turned into a mini-banquet with everyone ordering biriyani, fried rice and even soup. 

>Free advice: the hotels may say they take cards for payment, but the GPRS signal may be too low that they won't work. So carry a good amount of liquid cash.

All along the way we talked on and on about our office lives and college days. Many memories were refereshed and I think that is the best thing about going in a trip with collegemates. There was one memory of our friend that stood out. Let's call him X. X was a charming intellectual with an extreme appetitie for sleep. X always makes it through the exams somehow. Like every other engineering student, it is the late night combine study that helps all of us, including X. It was the internal exams time. It counts for 50 marks at the University. This time it was Maths for our branch. All of us prepped well, digested the formulas and marched onto the examination hall. In the examination hall, students are seated so that no one from the same branch sits close to each other. Also the branch will be split into groups and placed in different examination halls. It so happened that X was the only one from our branch in his examination hall. He didn't mind. We finished our exams, went back to the hostel and started discussing the paper. As were discussing, X stepped in and started listening to the answers. X started panicking, he didn't get any of the answers that we got. After a few minutes, he started saying that none of the questions we mentioned were in his paper. We also got confused. That is when it struck all of us. X had written the physics paper of another branch. The whole two hours of the exam, X gladly sat there, attempted all the questions, handed over the answer sheet to the examiner, walked away confidently and never realized that it was not the Maths paper. Oh man, you should have seen the look on X's face. He immidietly went to the Maths department to see our professor. The entire department burst into laughter. Our professor only had to say the following, _"In my 25 years of teaching experience, I have never seen or heard such an incident ever happening."_. He got away with it and got his retest. This is one memory that still makes all of us laugh till our cheekbones hurt. The only reason, I am not revealing the identity of X is because if he gets pissed, he might hack this blog of mine. 

I am sorry, I think I got carried away. So where were we? Yes, I was in the driving seat with sixty kms left to Bhalukpong. I must say I was lucky. I got the best road with zero traffic. There was dense forest on both sides and a smooth road ahead with the yellow evening sunlight shining upon us. As I was speeding along, we glanced a small river on our right side. We decided to take a stop and have a look. We couldn't find a way to the banks of the river. Appu and myself spoke to the local children and they showed us the way. The river bank was layed with beautiful stones, almost looked like a scene from [NPCB](https://twitter.com/npcbmovie/status/493634214860840960). It was the Kameng river that actually joined the Brahmaputra. We snapped some pics and continued the journey. We reached Bhalukpong checkpost. This is the first place where we had to show the ILP of each passenger. The army men just had a quick glance through the paperwork and passed us through. I spoke to a senior army man, asking him for hotels nearby. He told me he was posted there only the day before and didn't much about the area. He did tell us, why the place was called 'Bhalukpong'. It has something to do with bears (Bhalu is bear in hindi) coming over from the forest for a drink. 

We got a nice deal at a lodge, Hotel Tazi Yangste. As we were settling down, we met with our next surprise. I saw Kartha and Sajeev talking with some of our batchmates from our [college](http://tkmce.ac.in/). We knew their team had gone a week before to Tawang, but we never imagined seeing them along the way. [Vishnu](https://www.facebook.com/vishnu.gopakumar.39), [Shahanshah](https://www.facebook.com/shahanshahs), [Potti](https://www.facebook.com/sreehari.varma.311) and [Sreeram](https://www.facebook.com/sreerampr.ala) had all gone in rented bikes. What freaked me out, was their costumes - jacket upon jacket with thermals inside, gloves on the hands and gum boots on their legs. They were in a hurry and very quickly they gave a brief summary of Tawang and the road ahead to BumLa. Their tips really helped us. The good news was that there was snow at the top, but they warned us that getting to the top in a four wheeler may be not allowed by the army, if there is heavy snow. We bid them farewell and settled down at the hotel after having some delicious chicken momos. We tucked in early since we wanted to leave early in the morning.
