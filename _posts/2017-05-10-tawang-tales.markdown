**The Plan**

_"The time has come to escape somewhere. Somewhere remote, somewhere wild and beautiful at the same time"._

This was all I could think of for the past few weeks and I would browse [tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.in/) and other blogs for the perfect escape. I was confused.

_"Should I go alone or should I call my friends? It would be boring to go solo. But who would have the time and budget to make such a trip!"_

And I was nowhere near to finding a destination as well. As I was knocking around these thoughts in my mind, I got a call from [Appu](https://plus.google.com/101526879864814957864). Appu is a guy who doesn't do the usual chit-chat. He gets straight to the point. 

_"Shall we go to north-east, Aslam?"_, he asked. Oh boy! You know, when what you are searching for finds you, it brings a special joy. I told him, I was also making a plan. He said that we just have to fix the dates, book the tickets and the rest we can plan along the way. The game was on. Other heads started popping in. It turned out that every one was exhausted by the dreaded office life and they all dreamt of a break. The NE trip WhatsApp group was born. [Sajeev](https://www.facebook.com/619aswin), [Prasad](https://www.facebook.com/ashwin.prasad.54), [Kartha](https://www.facebook.com/vipinvkartha), [Deepu](https://www.facebook.com/deepuc1) and [Sebastian](https://www.facebook.com/sebastianthom) joined the trip. So many of our common friends had already visited places in north-east India. The amazing [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix6MUQ31j9k) they made became one of our many inspirations to go to north-east. There were so many choices in north-east ranging from Gangtok, Chirapunji, Meghalaya and the list goes on.

_"Boys, Let's go to Gangtok. Plan later, book the tickets first before the rates go sky high."_, said Appu. We obliged. After careful consideration of available dates, we booked flight tickets to [Guwahati Airport](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Lokpriya+Gopinath+Bordoloi+International+Airport/@26.1064727,91.5860468,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x69ba1fb4e82844d8?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj2gM3pgOXTAhUMso8KHQhZA5MQ_BIIgAEwCg). The dates were from Apr 29 to May 7. All of us booked the cheapest flights (SpiceJet, of course!) and started looking for itineraries to Gangtok. Meanwhile, I started calling travel groups to get an estimate of how much the trip would cost each of us. My calculations put me at 25,000 INR per person for 7 days including airfare. We had already booked the tickets, and there was no going back. So the planning continued. 

_"Hey have you heard of Tawang and Sela pass? It is a remote place, and very beautiful too. Check it out!"_. As soon as Kartha mentioned Tawang, the group came alive. The words, **Tawang, the Hidden Paradise**, instantly caught my attention. It is not as famous as the other tourist spots, which means lesser tourists, more freedom. There is a chance of finding snow in Sela Pass, which is on the way to Tawang. Everyone started digging up photos and itineraries for Tawang. Everyone except Sebastian maybe. If I remember properly, he was ok with anything as long as we were all going. So, Tawang it was. 

Now the next crucial element of the trip, the instrument of transport. It was **rent a bike** Vs **rent a cab** Vs **self-drive car**. The **rent a cab** option quickly went out of the window. Incidentally, one of our friends had already gone to Tawang. He shared with us the pictures of Dirang Valley and the wonderful condition of the roads and hairpins that lay ahead. He warned us that self-driving is dangerous and tedious. Even their cab driver was having a tough time. The warning had the reverse effect. Everyone took it as a challenge to ride the roads, rather than to sit in the back of some stranger's car. And the **rent a bike** option was crossed out since most of us were better at driving cars than riding bikes. So we booked a Mahindra Scorpio from ZoomCar for 7 days. They recently started out in Guwahati, so it was the perfect timing for us. We didn't pre-book any hotels. Sajeev and I were not so happy with that decision, but after a sarcastic lecture from Appu on how overplanning ruins the fun of a trip, we gave in. It turned out to be the right decision.

**Day Zero- Apr 28, 2017**

Did I forget to mention the Inner Line Permit (ILP)? I guess I did. ILP is mandatory in many places in north-east. Because these are border areas with a lot of army presence. I read in some [blogs](https://thelazytravellersnews.wordpress.com/2015/05/24/arunchal-pradesh-tawang-darshan-inner-line-permit-and-bumla-pass-process/) that getting them offline in the Guwahati office can be a bit of a hassle. So we opted for the [online](http://arunachalilp.com/) application. The online application costs 100 INR per head and the offline only 10 INR. It takes a few days, but you will get it. Additional to the ILP, we also took a copy of an ID-proof. 

>Free advice: Let me tell you in advance that one copy is not enough. Take 4-5 copies of ID-proof and 2 copies of ILP if you are planning to visit BumLa Pass. The additional ID-proof copies may come handy when you are booking the hotel in Tawang.

Sebastian and Prasad had come to my place in Bangalore. Appu should also have joined us, but he preferred to stay with his friends in Mysore. His buddies there were planning to go to Nandi Hills on bikes, so they dropped Appu on the way. He later regretted that decision, because he lost all his sleep. The four of us had straight flights ahead from Bangalore airport to Guwahati airport. Sajeev and Deepu were to fly in from Chennai Airport with a stop in Kolkata. Poor Guys! They were the first ones to reach Guwahati and grabbing the Scorpio from ZoomCar was their duty. Kartha was to fly in from Pune and land at the same time as the Bangalore bunch. With the last check on our backpacks, we flew off to Guwahati.

---

**Day One - Apr 29, 2017**

For a change, the Spice Jet flights arrived on time. Guwahati Airport was neither well maintained nor large as its Bangalore counterpart. It had a parking lot the size of two Basket Ball courts. All of us took our backpacks and grabbed a seat in the nearest KFC. No, we didn't have KFC for breakfast. We were just waiting for Sajeev and Deepu to come and pick us up in the Scorpio. An hour passed, waiting for them. Meanwhile, we took out our cameras and inspected them. Sebastian had brought a digital Nikon. That camera had a mind of its own. From time to time it would zoom in and out. Plus, the capture button was too stubborn. It would not work no matter how hard I pressed. Deepu had also brought a camera. It was an oldie but still functioned properly. Fortunately, Deepu and Appu had iPhones. So that would suffice. 

It was almost 10.30 am. At last, they came with the Scorpio, a mighty blue beast. We hoped on and the first thing that we did was check the fuel and tire pressure. Deepu was the navigator and Sajeev was the driver. We set the destination to Bhalukpong and drove on. None of us had eaten anything and were extremely hungry. We looked for hotels on the highway, but couldn't find anything decent. The view along the road reminded me of Kerala. There were a lot of green pastures, paddy fields, and small hills. However, Guwahati didn't have the one thing Kerala has, an amplitude of hotels along the highway. Finally, we settled for a small hotel. There was no menu as such.There was only Poori and Sabji. That become our brunch. Two hours into the trip and I realized that sitting in the back of the Scorpio is a pain in the ass. So we decided to stop here-and-there and shift places and the driver.

There are some tourist places in Guwahati, temples mostly. We didn't stop at any of those places because we wanted to reach Bhalkupong before sunset. The road ahead was in good condition. We didn't face any traffic. We did get a bit lost when we tried for a detour near Tezpur. The detour took us through a small village. We were a bit surprised. It looked exactly like a village you would see in Alleppy. We even saw a grandma coming out of the church in the traditional Kerala Christian attire. Someone in the back asked, _"Did we loose our way and end up in Keralam?"_. The similarities were that close. Even the shops and markets resembled that of Kerala from the 2000s. We passed a lot of schools on the way. Oddly, almost all schools had white uniforms and senior girls had to wear sarees. Pretty soon we got back on the Highway and stopped for a cup of tea. The tea session quickly turned into a mini-banquet with everyone ordering biriyani, fried rice, and even soup. 

>Free advice: the hotels may say they take cards for payment, but the GPRS signal may be too low that they won't work. So carry a good amount of liquid cash.

All along the way, we talked on and on about our office lives and college days. Many memories were refreshed and I think that is the best thing about going on a trip with college mates. There was one memory of our friend that stood out. Let's call him X. X was a charming intellectual with an extreme appetite for sleep. X always makes it through the exams somehow. Like every other engineering student, it is the late night combine study that helps all of us, including X. It was the internal exams time. It counts for 50 marks at the University. This time it was Maths for our branch. All of us prepped well, digested the formulas and marched to the examination hall. In the examination hall, students are seated so that no one from the same branch sits close to each other. Also, the branch will be split into groups and placed in different examination halls. It so happened that X was the only one from our branch in his examination hall. He didn't mind. We finished our exams, went back to the hostel and started discussing the paper. As were discussing, X stepped in and started listening to the answers. X started panicking, he didn't get any of the answers that we got. After a few minutes, he started saying that none of the questions we mentioned were in his paper. We also got confused. That is when it struck all of us. X had written the physics paper of another branch. The whole two hours of the exam, X gladly sat there, attempted all the questions, handed over the answer sheet to the examiner, walked away confidently and never realized that it was not the Maths paper. Oh man, you should have seen the look on X's face. He immediately went to the Maths department to see our professor. The entire department burst into laughter. Our professor only had to say the following, _" In my 25 years of teaching experience, I have never seen or heard such an incident ever happening."_. He got away with it and got his retest. This is one memory that still makes all of us laugh till our cheekbones hurt. The only reason, I am not revealing the identity of X is because if he gets pissed, he might hack this blog of mine. 

I am sorry, I think I got carried away. So where were we? Yes, I was in the driving seat with sixty km left to Bhalukpong. I must say I was lucky. I got the best road with zero traffic. There was a dense forest on both sides and a smooth road ahead. The golden evening sunlight was slowly fading away into the horizon. As I was speeding along, we glanced a small river on our right side. We decided to take a stop and have a look. We couldn't find a way to the banks of the river. Appu and I spoke to the local children and they showed us the way. The river bank was laid with beautiful stones, almost looked like a scene from [NPCB](https://twitter.com/npcbmovie/status/493634214860840960). It was a part of the Kameng river that went on to join the Brahmaputra. We snapped some pics and continued the journey. We reached Bhalukpong check post. This is the first place where we had to show the ILP of each passenger. The army men just had a quick glance through the paperwork and passed us through. I spoke to a senior army man, asking him for hotels nearby. He told me he was posted there only the day before and didn't know much about the area. He did tell us, why the place was called 'Bhalukpong'. It has something to do with bears (Bhalu is bear in Hindi) coming over from the forest for a drink. 

We got a nice deal at a lodge, Hotel Tazi Yangste. As we were settling down, we met with our next surprise. I saw Kartha and Sajeev talking with some of our batchmates from our [college](http://tkmce.ac.in/). We knew their team had gone a week before to Tawang, but we never imagined seeing them along the way. [Vishnu](https://www.facebook.com/vishnu.gopakumar.39), [Shahanshah](https://www.facebook.com/shahanshahs), [Potti](https://www.facebook.com/sreehari.varma.311) and [Sreeram](https://www.facebook.com/sreerampr.ala) had all gone in rented bikes. What freaked me out, was their costumes - jacket upon jacket with thermals inside, gloves on the hands and gum boots on their legs. They were in a hurry and very quickly they gave a brief summary of Tawang and the road ahead to BumLa. Their tips really helped us. The good news was that there was snow at the top, but they warned us that if there is heavy snowfall, getting to the top in a four wheeler may be not allowed by the army. We bid them farewell and settled down at the hotel. We all had some delicious chicken momos. We tucked in early since we wanted to leave early in the morning.

**Day Two - Apr 30, 2017**

I somehow woke up at 4.30 am in the morning. The plan was to leave at 5:00 am sharp because the destination was Tawang and there were plenty of bad roads ahead. I was surprised to see that sun was already up by 5:00 am. I had heard about the demand for a separate time zone for north-eastern states. Only now did it make sense to me. All of us had decided the earlier night that we will rotate the seating position every one hour. It was almost 6 am when we departed from Bhalukpong. Sajeev started the drive as usual. The river Kameng was by our side and offered some beautiful scenery. Every few kilometers we could see JCBs and Bull Dozers parked on the side, ready for maintenance. A landslide can occur anytime and block the roads. Deepu had informed us that the day before we arrived in Guwahati, there was a violent storm that caused a lot of damage. I guess we were blessed with apt weather conditions. Most of the bridges we passed were made of steel and can only pass one vehicle at a time. If we see any other vehicle coming in from the distance we have to honk them and let them know we are coming. Right after Sajeev, when Prasad took over the driving, we had to stop our Scorpio for nearly 5 mins to let an array of army trucks pass. 

We stopped for breakfast in the nearest tea stall we saw. There is a minimum waiting period of half an hour after you place the order since it takes longer to cook in the higher altitudes. While things were cooking, I had a chat with a young teenage boy. 

_"Hi there, we are from Kerala."_.  He seemed very happy to see South Indians. I asked his name, but can't recollect it now.

_"So which tribe do you belong to?"_

He said, _"I am from Nimji Tribe, but most people living here are from Akho Tribe. Each tribe has its own language and we don't understand each other."_ 

_"So is it true that there are more than 200 languages spoken in the entire North-East?"_

He laughed at me and said,_"200 may be only the accounted number. There must be a lot. Even I don't know the exact number."_

By this time, his younger sister came out. When I asked her name, she gave a toothless smile and hid behind her brother. I was about to leave when he gave me his facebook id and asked me to add him. I chuckled and said, _"Ya ya. Sure. Bye bye!"_

Our order had arrived; hot Maggie plus tea.It tasted good and we left. The road up to Bomdilla was fine, but after that, we saw the worst roads ever. The parts of the roads where maintenance was going on were filled with dirt, three inches thick. The parts where road tarring was going on, was full of dust and bumps. It took nearly 2 hours for us to get onto some freshly serviced road. It felt like heaven. For lunch again, we stopped at a small stall. These stalls are held by bamboo sticks on the mountain side. The whole building distributes its weight through these sticks. We could literally see the deep cliff from the holes on the wooden floor. As we sat down admiring the ingenuity of the building, Maggie noodles and tea arrived for the second time. Kartha, Deepu, and Sajeev wanted to try something different and they ordered Chicken Tukpa. It is nothing but noodles in their native style. 

>Free advice: Don't order Tukpa.

Along the way, we could see a lot of army stations. Each unit has its own name and purpose. Photography in these areas is prohibited and there are speed breakers along the road to make sure that we drive slow. These stations are well maintained and we can approach these army men for any help we need. Also to point out that among the few ATMs that we saw along the road, most were situated near to these army stations. By evening, we had reached Dirang. We were running low on fuel. We took the Scorpio to the nearest petrol pump. Since we rented the vehicle from ZoomCar, the fuel bills will be reimbursed. However, we need printed bills from the pump for reimbursement. This small little pump was out of printing paper. After a few minutes of discussion, we pumped diesel worth 500 INR, took the manual bill and left. Something is better than nothing. 

It was almost 4:30 pm, but the sunlight had nearly gone out. Thick fog was starting to set in. Appu was driving and was having a hard time seeing the road. The fog lights and indicators were turned on. To the left of the road were sharp ridges, which was clouded by the fog. As we slowly made our way through the fog, tiny dots began to appear against the front window frame. It was not waterdrops. Then we began to hear the sound of particles hitting the car. For a moment we were worried, was it hailstones, but it was not that hard or big. It was snowfall!

_"Look man, it's snowfall"_, 
exclaimed everyone. We lowered the side window panels and saw actual snowfall. Everyone was excited and joyous because it was a first time experience for everyone. It lasted only for a couple of minutes and then the fog cleared. Everything was back to normal. From a far distance, we saw the 'Welcome to Tawang' gate and we knew we had reached Sela Pass. We parked the car and all of us posed for a group picture. There were sheets of snow lying around and it was too cold. At the moment, I was wearing my casual clothes. Very bad move there. Within seconds, my hands and feet started to ache and I had to switch to shoes, gloves and a jacket. We shut all the windows and turned the A/C knob towards the warmer side. That was the first time, I used that option in a vehicle. We rotated our seats and Kartha climbed onto the driver seat. Sunlight was fading away. It also started to shower a little and we still had more than 70 km to cover to reach Tawang. To make things worse, the condition of the road was that of an abandoned battlefield. We knew that the next town ahead was Jang. We decided that if we find any lodge in Jang we shall spend the night there. It was 7:00 pm when we reached Jang. We found a lodge, but the owner said that if you drive for one more hour you will be able to reach Tawang. By this time, the battery of almost all phones was down and there was limited network. Fortunately, Sebastian had downloaded the offline map on his phone and he was getting the GPS signal as well. So he became our navigator in the dark of the night. 

We drove on, climbing hairpin after hairpin with no human being in the near sight. We found a building with lights on. It turned out to be a Paying Guest House. Appu and I got out of the car and went inside. We were greeted by a chubby little man. 

_"Namaste, where are you from?"_, He came out with his hands folded. We introduced ourselves and explained our situation.

_"Nothing to worry. Rooms are available. For seven people, you will need two rooms. One room will cost you 2500. And you guys want to go to the Monastery and visit BumLa, right? I can arrange that. I am the philosophy teacher here at the Monastery."_
He was very polite and we continued to converse for a few more minutes. I wanted to take the rooms. But he mentioned that if we were to go forward four-five kilometers, we would reach Tawang main town. _"There are lodges there as well"_. We decided to try it out and come back to his place if we didn't get anything. 

As we went ahead, we started seeing more building lights. It was a relaxing sight. We have been driving the whole day, starting from 6:00 am in the morning. Everyone was tired. Once we reached the main town, we knocked and inquired at a couple of lodges. We finally took two rooms in Shampala Hotel for just 2000 INR. Also, all the restaurants had closed down at that hour. Luckily our Hotel manager mentioned that something should be available at their sister hotel. I went to check. It was completely locked from the outside. I had to knock at their door for a few minutes before a boy came out. There was only chow mien was available, so I placed an order for seven Chicken chowmien. I promised to come back in half an hour and went to the room. The rooms were not centrally heated. This meant that the bed and blankets were ice cold. We had to lie down and use our body heat to make them sleepable. Someone brought the food from the sister hotel. Sadly, instead of seven, there was only five. We shared the food, filled our tummies and crept into the bed. Never before had I eaten noodles three times in a day!

---

**Day Three - May 01, 2017**

Finally, we had reached Tawang on the third day. _"Mission accomplished"_, 
we whispered among ourselves. The first thing I did after waking up from bed was to go to the terrace. I wanted to get a good look since we drove to Tawang in the pitch-black, we had no clue about our surroundings. Fresh cold air breezed through my bare feet. I could see clouds of fog gently coming down from the snow-capped mountains. It was 7 am and sunlight was creeping through. Most of the shops were already open and the street looked busy. First thing on the list was to take a nice hot bath. That plan was shattered in an instant; the heater was not working. That's what happens when you go for budget hotels. Let's say, I somehow managed it. 

>Free advice: Bathing in icy cold water can bring a tingling (bearable) pain to your hands and feet. It will last for a few hours and pass away.

By around 9.30 am all of us was ready. We didn't have much planned for the day. Visiting Tawang Monastery and obtaining the pass to BumLa; these were the only things on our bucket list. Unlike other towns we passed like Dirang or Bomdilla, Tawang looked more well built and organized. Our hotel was in Nehru Market and had some good restaurants nearby. For breakfast, we had lots of options -  Rice (Chaval), Chowmein, Paratha, and Poori. All of us ordered Rice with Chicken and Mushroom curries. It really tasted good. On the side, there was a notice that said that non-veg and alcohol will not be served on Wednesdays in Tawang. It was according to Buddhist customs, I believe. After our breakfast, we went to the DC office to get the pass to BumLa. Prasad drove us. We had to stop at every junction and ask for directions. We finally made it what looked like a small municipal office building. There were no boards around and we didn't we couldn't distinguish between the army men and security guards by the uniform. After a few minutes of roaming around, a man came up to us and asked us,
_"You have come to get the pass, right? Wait here. I will give you the form"_

We thought he would be the clerk. He actually turned out to be the DC himself. He gave me a form to fill. We had to give all our names and address details. He asked for our vehicle RC. I hesitated for a moment, following which he frowned and asked me,

_"In whose name is the vehicle registered to?"_

_"None Sir. We actually rented it from a company called Zoomcar. It is registered to them"_

_"The RC is not in any of the passenger's name?"_

_"No Sir."_

_"Then I can't give you the pass. You will have to hire a local cab and his RC will have to be used"_

_"But Sir.."_

_"Listen. Listen. You will easily get a cab. Come back with him. Also, bring two copies of all your permits and address proofs. Ok?"_

_"Ok Sir. Thanks"_

_"Hurry up."_ With these words he gestured me to leave the office. Many others were waiting in the queue. 

So that was our experience in getting the BumLa pass. We were a bit disappointed. Not only will we have to pay the cab driver, we will miss the chance to drive on our own. Nevertheless, we decided to get a cab after getting back to Nehru Market. The Monastery was nearby. So we headed off to there. The Tawang Monastery was the largest in India and for some of us, it was the first time visiting a Buddhist Monastery. We saw the Monastery up ahead, but it looked deserted except for a few taxi cars parked. Deepu was in the front seat and asked a fellow passing monk, if it indeed was the Monastery and if we could go in. He nodded his head and walked away with a smile. Prasad parked the car. I grabbed Sebastian's camera and started clicking pictures. We could see the whole of Tawang town from this point.There was a giant Buddist prayer wheel outside. Their prayer 'Om mani padme hum' was written all over the drum in Tibetan language: 'སྤྱན་རས་གཟིགས'. It has six syllables, each denoting a certain human quality. As we slowly made our way inside, I saw Appu and Sajeev talking to a young couple. Turns out that they from Kerala as well. After a small chit-chat, they went on their way. There were not many tourists around and strangely there were very few monks around as well. We entered the main praying hall. It was hard to believe that building was made in the 17th century. I saw many people sitting down on the vertical mats. Some were meditating, others were just posing for their friend's camera. I decided to take a good look around.

The main Buddhist statue was huge. It looked similar to one of those architecturally marvelous Cathedrals. There were smaller statues of monks. Each of them carried a different object in their hands. I later learned that it represented the six syllables of their prayer. Many devotees had left money and eatables near the statue. There were yellow vertical prayer mats hanging from the ceiling. The place for monks to be seated was covered in a satin cushion. Since there were no prayers going on, we explored other doors and stairs. Outside the prayer hall, there was a museum as well. The rest of the buildings were the living quarters of the monks. That's what we assumed, because there were no monks around to confirm. Kartha said we should have come when the prayers are going on. There is a special ambiance in the prayers that is energizing. We moved on to the ropeway that takes you to Ani Gompa. It is at walking distance from the Monastery. As we were making our way, we saw a group of cab drivers. We asked them if they could take us to BumLa. They gave me a number of their friend. I made the call and the driver agreed to take the seven of us for 4500 INR. I agreed, the standard rate was 5000 INR. He agreed to meet us at our Hotel at 2:00 pm. There was a small crowd near the ropeway. We thought we could easily go in the next round. Unfortunately, we had bad news. The rides ahead have already been booked and they only take six people at a time. That was the second disappointment of the day. 

>Free advice: Book the ropeway in advance. 200 INR per head. Timings from 9:00 am to 3:00 pm.

It was only 1:00 pm. We went back to our Scorpio and discussed what we should do. We needed to check the vehicle. After yesterday's strenuous journey, the brakes and tires needed to be checked. The cab driver had already mentioned a garage down the road run by a guy called, Babloo. _"Best guy in Tawang"_, that's how they described him. So we split into two groups. One group took the Scorpio to the garage and others went back to the hotel. Most of us were also tired by the long journey and needed more rest. On the way back, Appu mentioned that he saw a board that said - 'Cycles for rent'. I, Appu and Sajeev decided to check it out. The store name was - 'MyTawang'. They rent bikes, cycles and other adventure apparels. The bikes were in good condition, but I can't say the same about cycles. There were five Btwin mountain cycles at the store. The owner said three were already booked and he could only give us two cycles. Each cycle costs 500 INR for a day. One cycle didn't have the front brake. I took that one adjusted the seat height and started riding alongside Appu. As we rode through the street, all eyes were fixated on us, because none rides a cycle on those hilly roads. Appu was having a very hard time making it up the hill. He was also not too familiar with gear shifting. I changed his gears to the lowest gear combination possible. After just a few kilometers, we found ourselves gasping for air. I think it has to do with the altitude. Onlookers were smirking at us, but we paid no attention. Since I had to meet up with the cab driver to BumLa, I went back to our hotel and gave the cycle to Sajeev. Once again, I found myself giving him a quick lesson on gear shifting. 

Time passed and I got tired of waiting for the cab driver. It was getting close to 3:30 pm and there was no sign of him. He was not picking up the calls as well. I decided to take a stroll down the street and saw a board - 'East Line Tours and Travels'. Just out of curiosity, I went in and enquired the cost for hiring a cab to BumLa. The man in the black jacket there said,

_"Driver is available. But DC office will close by 4:00 pm. When do you want to go?"_

That's when I realized shit is going to happen again._"We are seven people. We need to go tomorrow itself."_

_"Oh! Well, it will be tough. For seven people one Sumo is enough. Do you have the ILP copies and ID proofs?"_

_"Ya, I do"_. I showed him the documents.

_"It will cost you 5000 INR. For now, you need to give me 500 INR advance. You should have come in the morning."_

Without giving it a second thought, I handed over the money and the xerox copies. _"What will happen if the DC office closes?"_

_"You will get it. You will get it. Now we will have to go to his house and collect the pass. Just pray that the officer doesn't have any other plans. Come back here in the evening and I will tell you."_

I thanked him and left. I felt irritated that I didn't do this a few hours earlier. The team that had gone to the garage was back and walking down the road. Appu and Sajeev were also there with the cycles. I told them everything. We just looked at each other. Kartha said, _"We are not leaving Tawang, without going to BumLa. Otherwise, the trip would be worth nothing!"_. We all nodded in agreement. By this time, everyone already had lunch and I was the only one left. They pointed me towards a good restaurant, 'Mon-valley restaurant'. I went straight in. The good news was that they had beef. As I sat there waiting for my order to come, I pondered on how to restructure the trip, if were to spend an additional day in Tawang. At the same time, the man in the black jacket from the travel agency walked into the restaurant. He saw me, gave me a hand wave and shouted,

_"Your pass is ready! Be ready by 7:00 am tomorrow. Come to my shop, Ok?"_

That was the best moment of the day. _"Wow! That was fast. Thanks a lot!"_

_" I told you, you will get it"_.
Uttering these words he immersed into a conversation with the restaurant owner. They looked similar, maybe they were relatives. I couldn't tell for sure. Most of the north-eastern people looked the same to me. My friend had mentioned of this to his north-eastern friend. His reply was that he felt the same way about the South-Indians. I am sure my friend didn't see such a reply coming. The man in the black jacket went into the kitchen and grabbed something to eat. I think being a small town, everyone there just knows everybody. My order came. It was the tastiest meal I had since we started our trip. Everything was cooked to the optimum and the flavors were just correct. I left with a happy tummy. I noticed that I had some miscalls on my phone. It was the original cab driver, he was waiting at the hotel. I met him and explained the situation. He didn't complain. He went on his way. 

I saw that Appu and Sajeev were back with the cycles. They looked tired and were done with riding. There was still some daylight remaining and I wanted to go for one more ride. So I took it downhill, away from the town and avoiding the stares of people. I coasted down without pedaling, enjoying the view and the air. Hairpin after hairpin I started going faster. I only stopped when it struck me that I have to climb up all those hairpins. It is a pleasant feeling when you lay down on the mountain grass bed, staring at the sky. Fast forward a few minutes of solitude, I was struggling against the hill. I only remember making it back without stopping anywhere. 

The cycle store was on the Old Market Road. This is the major shopping area in Tawang. Lots of shopping selling clothes and sandals. I bumped into an antique shop. There was no one in the shop except for an old man and a young lady dusting off the items on the shelf. She was about to approach me and ask me what I wanted. The old man stopped her. He talked to her in Hindi (assuming that I didn't know Hindi), _"These young people will not buy anything. Let him have a look and then he will leave"_. Well, he was absolutely right. I didn't speak a word and simply stared from shelf to shelf. There were Chinese style clay pots, huge flasks and plenty of laughing buddhas. There were prayer flags and mats that resembled the ones we saw in the Monastery. Lots of small decorated knives were hanging down. Also for the first time in my life, I saw an actual Samurai Katana. It actually weighs a lot more than you expect. Then there were other items that I don't know how to describe. Anyway, I moved on to another cloth shop. There I bargained for a sweater. Even though  I got a good price, I decided to buy it the next day and left for my hotel.

As I walked up to my room, the hotel owner called me and asked me to fill the entries in his register. Since we booked the room at midnight, we hadn't done that. As I finished filling in the details, I noticed that the owner was watching an IPL game live on the TV. It was Mumbai Vs Bangalore. Out of curiosity I asked him,

_"IPL ha. You like cricket?"_

_"Ya. Why not?"_ answered the owner, without taking his eyes off the screen.

_"But, do you guys play Cricket? I mean I know you guys play football a lot but I didn't see any cricket grounds anywhere in these hills."_. Now I had his attention.

_"We have grounds."_. Then he mentioned some names, which I don't remember. _"We even have Tawang Premier League every year. This year's league just got over."_

Now I was impressed. I didn't want to stop the conversation. _"I see. The young people here at Tawang, what do they do after school? Do they go to college or for work?"_

_"College? Yes, those who study well go to college. We don't have a college here. Many go to Delhi or some other place. Some go to Bangalore and other places in South. Others will start with their parents; doing business or other work as they get. It is all good."_

He was on a roll. _"Some of my family members are in the US as well. There are people from Tawang settled in the UK and abroad. Yes, there are many."_

He understood that I was really impressed. I continued, _"So Sir, we have come a long way from the south to see your place and people. I am just wondering where do you guys go for vacation?"_

_"What vacation? We don't go that many places. But you should understand, we are Buddhist people right. We mostly visit Buddhist places. We go to the shrine in Ladakh, in Coorg and other places nearby."_

_"So don't you want to go to Tibet then?"_

_"Yes, of course. But it is not that simple. Do you know that we can go to China without Indian passport?"_

_"What! Without passport? How?"_

_"See that's the thing. China wants to make parts of Arunachal Pradesh theirs, including Tawang. So if we go to the Chinese embassy for Visa, they will say we will give you Visa if you don't submit your Indian Passport. They are telling us that we are already Chinese and don't need the passport. They are trying to woo us in. That's one among the many reasons, the army is stationed here. And we don't accept this offer from the embassy you see, even though we would love to visit Tibet. If we did that it will increase the tensions between India and China."_

_" That's a tough situation."_

_"Yes. But this is how it has been for a very long time. We just hope it changes in the future."_

_"Hmm. Alright, Sir. I don't want to disturb you from your game. Good night."_

_"Good night. What's your plan for tomorrow?"_

_"We are going to BumLa."_

_"Good. Good. You will like it."_

_"Ok Sir."_. Off I went to the room. We discussed what we should wear for tomorrow. After putting our phones and cameras for charging, we went to sleep.

**Day Four - May 02, 2017**

We were ready by 7:00 am and reached the travel agency's office. The office was open, but there was no one there. I tried to call, but no one picked up. I wondered if we were cheated but instantly ruled it out. The people there are known for their honesty and hospitality. After a few minutes, the man in the black jacket came. Just for a moment, I just thought how the hell he left his office all opened for that long. I guess that is how things work in the town of Tawang. Anyhow, we had to wait for some more time, since the driver was just on his way. We went to have breakfast in the meantime. There were no hotels or restaurants on the way. We all had multiple layers of clothing on to protect us from the cold. I thought I was the one with the most layers but Deepu had beaten us all. He wore two tshirts, one thermal, a sweater on top of them and a jacket on top of all of that. 

The driver came on his Tata Sumo. We paid the travel agency half the amount and got inside the Sumo. Appu had already stolen the front seat next to the driver. Everyone had their eyes on that seat. We all settled down, when the driver looked at Appu said,

_"A fat guy has to sit in the front seat"_. 
Appu was heart-broken. I was on the otherhand very excited; finally an advantage of being the fatter among the lot. So we set out to BumLa pass with me in the front seat. The driver started playing some old Bollywood songs on the stereo. He seemed like a cheerful guy. I asked his whereabouts. His name was Leyki; father of two boys aged two and three. Taking tourists to BumLa Pass was his main source of income. He had only gone yesterday he said and there was a heavy snowfall. Yet, he managed to take the travellers to the top. That was good news for us. It meant that we had a driver confident about taking us to the top even if the weather went rogue.
