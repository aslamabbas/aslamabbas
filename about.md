I am Aslam Abbas. I presently live in Bangalore, India. I am an ENTP or sometimes an ENTJ. My mind always pours out a lot of thoughts and ideas. I needed a place to jot them down. That is how this blog was born. I am always on the look out for new technologies and gadgets that revolutionizes the way people feel, think and live.

###What's your passion? 

This is the most haunting question, isn't it? It was an Independence day. I was in my 8th grade and standing along with my classmates in the school assembly line under the hot sun. The Chief guest of the day was delivering his speech. I listened to every heard he said. At one point, he said, "If you don't know what your passion is, you will never succeed in life, you will never be happy." The picture is still very clear. The old man's voice still echoes in my ear.  My passion has always been helping other people and I am true believer of Islam. My happiness lies in the happiness of others.
